     Deep within the heart of an ancient forest lay a secret known only to the trees and the wind. By day, sunlight trickled through the dense canopy, casting golden patterns on the mossy ground. But at twilight, the forest came alive with whispersâ€”gentle murmurs that wove together tales of forgotten times.

     One evening, a young wanderer named Elen stumbled upon the grove at the forest's core. In the center stood an ancient oak, its roots sprawling like the veins of the earth. The whispers grew louder, forming words only she could hear.

     "You carry the mark of the Listener," the oak said, its voice a deep rumble that seemed to shake the ground. "Will you guard our stories?"

     Elen hesitated but nodded, sensing the weight of the moment. A warm glow surrounded her as a silver leaf floated down, embedding itself in her palm.

     From that night on, Elen walked the world, carrying the stories of the forest, sharing their wisdom with anyone who dared to listen.
